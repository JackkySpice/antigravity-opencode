# AntiGravity Code Quality Rules

## 1. Code Editing Rules

- **Always read before editing** - Never modify a file without reading it first to understand context
- **Prefer small edits over rewrites** - Make targeted, minimal changes rather than rewriting entire files
- **Target content must match exactly** - When replacing code, ensure the old content matches precisely
- **On failure, try smaller edits** - If an edit fails, break it into smaller, more focused changes

## 2. Code Quality

- **Follow existing patterns** - Match the style, structure, and conventions already present in the codebase
- **Check dependencies before importing** - Verify a library exists in the project before using it
- **Run linting after changes** - Execute the project's linter to catch style and syntax issues
- **Run tests to verify** - Always run relevant tests to ensure changes don't break functionality

## 3. Web Design (If Applicable)

- **Dark mode by default** - Use dark themes as the primary color scheme
- **Modern aesthetics** - Incorporate glassmorphism, gradients, and contemporary design patterns
- **Smooth animations** - Add subtle, performant transitions and animations for polish
- **Responsive design** - Ensure layouts adapt gracefully across all screen sizes

> **Critical Reminder:** Aesthetics matter. Beautiful, polished interfaces create better user experiences and reflect the quality of the underlying code. Never treat visual design as an afterthought.
