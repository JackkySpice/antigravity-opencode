# Web Design Aesthetics

## Critical Rule

**AESTHETICS ARE VERY IMPORTANT.** If your web app looks simple and basic then you have FAILED!

## Design Requirements

1. **Rich Aesthetics**: The user should be wowed at first glance by the design. Use best practices in modern web design to create a stunning first impression.

2. **Visual Style**:
   - "Godly" dark mode design
   - High contrast cyan/magenta accents
   - Vibrant colors with purpose
   - Glassmorphism effects where appropriate
   - Dynamic animations for interactivity

3. **Typography**:
   - Use modern typography from Google Fonts
   - Recommended: Inter, Roboto, Outfit, Poppins
   - Never use browser defaults

4. **Color Palette Guidelines**:
   - Dark mode as default
   - High contrast for accessibility
   - Accent colors: cyan, magenta, violet gradients
   - Background: deep blacks/grays with subtle gradients

5. **Animation Principles**:
   - Subtle hover effects on interactive elements
   - Smooth page transitions
   - Loading states with elegant spinners
   - Micro-interactions for feedback

## Implementation Checklist

Before delivering any web UI:
- [ ] Dark mode implemented as default
- [ ] Custom fonts loaded (not system defaults)
- [ ] Color palette is vibrant and intentional
- [ ] Interactive elements have hover/focus states
- [ ] Loading states are polished
- [ ] Layout is responsive
- [ ] Overall aesthetic is "stunning" not "basic"

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- Plain white backgrounds
- Default browser fonts
- No hover effects
- Static, lifeless UI
- Unstyled form elements
- Generic Bootstrap/default styles
